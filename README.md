# Robotic_hand
The first prototype of the project is a  robotic hand  controled by voice to help amputees.
Working mechanism:
it takes audio signals from a mobile phone and converts them into strings through an app available on mobile.
We also used the HC05 to send audio signals via bluetooth to the Arduino connected to five of the micro servo motor 
Each servo motor is responsible for the movement of each finger separately.
Then we defined the range of motion of each finger, which is just the opening and closing of the finger
